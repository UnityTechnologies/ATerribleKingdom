# A Terrible Kingdom (Scripting for Timeline)

![Kingdom](https://i.imgur.com/D1dM4m3.png)

## Description

This project remixes the A Mighty Kingdom assets into a classic RTS game, to provide 3 examples of Scripting the Timeline in creative ways. The project goes together with the presentation Scripting for Timeline.

The whole demo is about Timeline, but a simple RTS game has been built to provide context to the Timelines. A semi-complex Cinemachine solution is also in the scene, made of two different FreeLook rigs, using GroupTarget and a dummy object to allow moving the camera with keys. The demo also uses Post-Processing Stack v1 and Navigation.

## Documentation
